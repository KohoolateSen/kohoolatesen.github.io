# Intro 

Welcome to the Internet Dumpster!
But don’t be fooled — not all dumpsters are filled with trash.
Not everyone is willing to dig through the mess — but for those who do, there are treasures waiting beneath the grime.

This site is where I share my “useful bullshits” — thoughts, tools, and tips mostly around networking, cybersecurity, programming, IT, and whatever else catches my interest in the tech world. You’ll find all that in the Blog section.

Over in the Hall of Fame, I often highlight pioneers of the Computer & IT industry — people whose contributions deserve more recognition than they get.

Thanks for dropping by.
Hope you find something that makes the dig worthwhile.
